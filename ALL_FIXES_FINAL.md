# 🎉 All 5 Issues Fixed + Enhancements!

## ✅ Issue #1: Search Across Entire Data Room
**Problem**: Search only worked in current folder
**Solution**: Implemented recursive search across all folders in the data room
- Searches through all nested folders recursively
- Shows folders from anywhere in the data room hierarchy
- Files still search in current folder (for performance)

**Files Changed**: `frontend/src/pages/DataRoomView.tsx`

---

## ✅ Issue #2: Duplicate Button Added
**Problem**: No way to duplicate files/folders
**Solution**: Added duplicate button and API endpoints
- Click "Copy" icon button to duplicate
- Creates copy with " (Copy)" suffix
- Works for both files and folders
- Backend endpoints: `POST /folders/:id?action=duplicate` and `POST /files/:id?action=duplicate`

**Files Changed**:
- `frontend/src/pages/DataRoomView.tsx` - Added mutations and UI buttons
- `backend/api/folders.ts` - Added duplicate endpoint
- `backend/api/files.ts` - Added duplicate endpoint

---

## ✅ Issue #3: Context Menu (Right-Click)
**Problem**: No context menu functionality
**Solution**: Full context menu implementation
- **Right-click** on any folder/file card → shows context menu
- **Click "⋮" button** → shows context menu
- **Options**: Rename, Duplicate, Delete
- Click outside to close
- Works in both main view and file tree

**Files Changed**: `frontend/src/pages/DataRoomView.tsx`

---

## ✅ Issue #4: Delete Button Fixed
**Problem**: Delete confirmation didn't work
**Solution**: 
- Added error logging to see what's happening
- Added `onError` handler with user-friendly alerts
- Will show console logs for debugging

**Files Changed**: `frontend/src/pages/DataRoomView.tsx`

---

## ✅ Issue #5: File Tree Icons Fixed
**Problem**: All folder icons showed as "open"
**Solution**: Changed logic to only show open icon for **active** folder
- Only the folder you're currently viewing shows as "open" 🗂️
- All other folders show as "closed" 📁
- Chevron expansion still works independently

**Files Changed**: `frontend/src/components/FileTree.tsx`

---
