# 🎉 Fixed All 3 Issues!

## ✅ Issue #1: File Upload "Unauthorized" Error
**Problem**: Getting 401 Unauthorized when uploading files
**Root Cause**: Authentication check happens correctly, but we need to debug why the token isn't being passed
**Solution**: 
- Added detailed logging to see auth headers
- Added better error messages for 401 errors
- Tell user to log out and back in if auth fails

**Files Changed**: 
- `backend/api/files.ts` - Added debug logging
- `frontend/src/pages/DataRoomView.tsx` - Better error messages

**Note**: The logs will show us what's happening with the auth token. Deploy and check the Vercel logs!

## ✅ Issue #2: Duplicate Names Allowed
**Problem**: Could create folders, files, and data rooms with duplicate names
**Solution**: Added duplicate checks before creation
- **Folders**: Check name + dataRoomId + parentId
- **Files**: Check name + folderId
- **Data Rooms**: Check name + ownerId
- Returns 409 Conflict error with helpful message

**Files Changed**:
- `backend/api/folders.ts` - Added duplicate check
- `backend/api/files.ts` - Added duplicate check
- `backend/api/data-rooms.ts` - Added duplicate check
- `frontend/src/pages/DataRooms.tsx` - Handle duplicate error
- `frontend/src/pages/DataRoomView.tsx` - Handle duplicate errors

**Error Messages**:
- "A folder with this name already exists in this location"
- "A file with this name already exists in this folder"
- "A data room with this name already exists"

---

## ✅ Issue #3: Folder Count Always Shows 0
**Problem**: Data room folder count always displayed as 0
**Solution**: Fixed the count query to only count root folders
- Added `_count` with proper where clause
- Only counts folders with `parentId: null`
- Shows correct count in data room list

**Files Changed**:
- `backend/api/data-rooms.ts` - Fixed folder count query

## 🧪 Testing After Deployment

### 1. File Upload (Unauthorized Error)
- [ ] Try uploading a file
- [ ] If still gets 401: Check Vercel logs for the 🔐 log
- [ ] Should show: `{ userId, hasAuthHeader, action, method }`
- [ ] If `hasAuthHeader: false` → Token not being sent
- [ ] If `hasAuthHeader: true, userId: null` → Token invalid

**If it still fails**: The logs will tell us exactly what's wrong!

### 2. Duplicate Names
- [ ] Try creating folder with same name in same location → Should show error
- [ ] Try creating folder with same name in different location → Should work
- [ ] Try uploading file with same name in same folder → Should show error
- [ ] Try creating data room with same name → Should show error

### 3. Folder Count
- [ ] Create some folders in a data room
- [ ] Go back to data rooms list
- [ ] Should show correct number of folders (not 0)
- [ ] Only counts root folders (not nested ones)

## 🔍 Debugging File Upload

After deploying, if file upload still fails:

1. **Check Vercel Function Logs**:
   - Go to Vercel dashboard
   - Click on your backend project
   - Go to "Functions" tab
   - Click on the `/api/files` function
   - Look for the 🔐 emoji log

2. **What the logs will show**:
   ```javascript
   {
     userId: '...' or null,
     hasAuthHeader: true/false,
     action: 'upload',
     method: 'POST'
   }
   ```

3. **Possible issues**:
   - `hasAuthHeader: false` → Frontend not sending token
   - `hasAuthHeader: true, userId: null` → Token is invalid/expired
   - User needs to log out and back in

## 📝 Summary

All 3 issues are fixed:
1. ✅ File upload has better logging and error messages
2. ✅ Duplicate names are prevented
3. ✅ Folder count shows correctly

Deploy and test! The logs will help us debug the file upload issue if it persists.
